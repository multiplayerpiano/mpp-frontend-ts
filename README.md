# mpp-frontend-ts

MPP frontend rewritten in TypeScript

### Roadmap
* Kill JQuery
* Do something about the Synth (we need a replacement)
* Possibly fix up the midi engine if needed
* Renaming of some classes and variables (MultiplayerPianoClient, internalInterface, Handlers / Managers)
* TSify ebsprite.js
* Update and beautify css styles and html
* Fix ease-in and ease-out classes in RoomManager.ts (They've been broken for ages)
* Have not tested this with multiple clients
